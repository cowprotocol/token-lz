## Overview

This repository contains CoW DAO's LayerZero OFT implementation:

- **OFTAdapter** (`CowOftAdapter.sol`): Adapts an existing ERC20 token on mainnet (COW token's main chain) using a lock/unlock mechanism
- **OFT** (`CowOft.sol`): Deployed on destination chains using a mint/burn mechanism

The OFTAdapter locks tokens on the origin chain, while OFT contracts on other chains mint/burn corresponding tokens to maintain cross-chain fungibility.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 18.16.0
- pnpm (or npm/yarn)
- Foundry (forge) >= 0.2.0

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Set deployer credentials in `.env`:
```
MNEMONIC="your mnemonic here"
# or
PRIVATE_KEY="0xabc...def"
```

4. Fund the deployer address with native tokens on target chains

## Compilation

Compile contracts using both Hardhat and Forge:
```bash
pnpm compile
```

Or compile individually:
```bash
pnpm compile:forge
pnpm compile:hardhat
```

## Deployment

### 1. Configure Token Address

In `hardhat.config.ts`, set the token address for the OFTAdapter on the origin chain. `<INNER_TOKEN_ADDRESS>` should be replaced with the native address of your token on its main network (which, in the case of CoW, is [`0xDEf1CA1fb7FBcDC777520aa7f396b4E015F497aB`](https://docs.cow.fi/governance/token) on mainnet):

```typescript
oftAdapter: {
    tokenAddress: '<INNER_TOKEN_ADDRESS>',
}
```

### 2. (optional) Configure Multisig Owner

Set up a Safe multisig at [https://app.safe.global](https://app.safe.global) and configure it in `hardhat.config.ts`:

```typescript
owner: {
    default: '<SAFE_ADDRESS>', // CoW DAO multisig
},
```

### 3. Deploy Contracts

Deploy the OFTAdapter on the origin chain (which, in CoW's case, is mainnet):
```bash
pnpm hardhat lz:deploy --tags CowOftAdapter --networks mainnet
```

Deploy OFT contracts on destination chains. You can find a list of chains to deploy on, or add your own, in `hardhat.config.ts`:
```bash
pnpm hardhat lz:deploy --tags CowOft --networks <destination-network>
```

#### Manually Verifying the Deployed Contracts


### Verifying Deployed Contracts Manually

The bytecode on-chain can be manually verified with the bytecode generated by solidity after running pnpm compile. For example, for the Mainnet OftAdapter:

```
# compile so we have the correct artifacts locally
pnpm compile
# get mainnet code for the deployed contract 
cast code 0x5c7E91F4a8e58e701bFE621990bd6Fa4FD7c5379 --rpc-url $RPC_URL_1
# get bytecode generated by solidity compilation
cat artifacts/contracts/CowOftAdapter.sol/CowOftAdapter.json | jq .deployedBytecode -r
```

The output of the lsat 2 commands can then be pasted into an editor without word wrap for comparison.

All bytes should be the same except for in a couple places--where the `immutable` variable for the lzEndpoint
is specified.

#### Etherscan Verification

The contracts can be verified on Etherscan by manually submitting the `solcInputs.json` file exported as
part of the deployments file:

1. Go to the contract on Etherscan (or whatever block explorer it is)
2. Go to the `Contract` tab and click "Verify and Publish"
3. Input:
  * Verification Method: `Solidity (Standard Json Input)`
  * Version: `0.8.30`
  * License: `MIT`
4. Upload the `solcInputs.json` file
5. Should be good to go.

### 4. Wire the Contracts

Generate wiring transactions:
```bash
pnpm hardhat lz:oapp:wire --oapp-config layerzero.config.ts --output-filename txns.json
```


When running the cmd you will be asked a couple questions, for which you can hit the "n" key as "no" for both:

```
a) ✔ Would you like to preview the transactions before continuing? … no
b) ✔ Would you like to submit the required transactions? … no
```


Convert transactions to Safe format:
```bash
node scripts/convert-to-safe-format.js txns.json
```

This will generate one json per network and the output should look like this:

```bash
Created safe-txns-eid-ethereum-mainnet.json with 9 transactions
Created safe-txns-eid-bsc-mainnet.json with 9 transactions
Created safe-txns-eid-avalanche-mainnet.json with 9 transactions
```

A series of files will be created in your project folder for transactions to execute on each network. Stage and Execute the generated batches through (Safe Transaction Builder)[https://app.safe.global/apps/open?appUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fapps-portal.safe.global%2Ftx-builder].

**Note:** When deploying in the Safe Transaction Builder, you may see a warning about the uploaded JSON file having invalid chain ID. These errors are expected due to an issue with LayerZero's providing of EVM chain ID mapping, and can be safely ignored. With this in mind, Please be careful to double check the network when uploading.

## Configuration

Edit `layerzero.config.ts` to configure:
- Cross-chain pathways
- DVN (Data Verification Network) settings
- Gas limits and enforced options
- Block confirmations

You can find more information about layerzero.config.ts on [LayerZero's website](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/get-started/create-lz-oapp/project-config#3-add-the-new-contract-and-connections-to-layerzeroconfigts).

Key configuration parameters:
```typescript
const EVM_ENFORCED_OPTIONS: OAppEnforcedOption[] = [
    {
        msgType: 1,
        optionType: ExecutorOptionType.LZ_RECEIVE,
        gas: 80000,  // Adjust based on destination chain gas profiling
        value: 0,
    },
]
```

## Important Commands

### Testing
```bash
pnpm test              # Run all tests (Forge + Hardhat)
pnpm test:forge        # Run Foundry tests
pnpm test:hardhat      # Run Hardhat tests
```

### Deployment
```bash
pnpm hardhat lz:deploy --tags <TAG> --networks <NETWORK>
```

`<TAG>` should be `CowOft` or `CowOftAdapter`, depending on which contract should be deployed on the current network.

`<NETWORK>` should be a declared hardhat network name in `hardhat.config.ts`.

### Sending Tokens

Its possible to use the CLI to send tokens once they are deployed:

```bash
pnpm hardhat lz:oft:send --src-eid <SOURCE_EID> --dst-eid <DEST_EID> --amount <AMOUNT> --to <ADDRESS>
```

### Contract Verification
```bash
pnpm dlx @layerzerolabs/verify-contract -n <NETWORK_NAME> -u <API_URL> -k <API_KEY> --contracts <CONTRACT_NAME>
```

### Linting
```bash
forge fmt          # Fix all files
```

Run tests with Foundry and Hardhat:
```bash
pnpm test              # Run all tests
pnpm test:forge        # Run Foundry tests only
pnpm test:hardhat      # Run Hardhat tests only
```
